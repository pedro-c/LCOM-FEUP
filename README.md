# LCOM-FEUP

Programmed, using C and Assembly, a Minix game, based on the pokemon series, which required a low level management and handling of system interruptions for several devices such as the mouse, keyboard, RTC and video ram.
This was the final project for LCOM (computer laboratories) course at FEUP.
